# mc-sorso
A translation of Minecraft's in-game strings to Solresol, an early conglang created by FranÃ§ois Sudre.

This project utilizes more recent innovations and resources regarding Solresol. See [the Wiki](https://github.com/c-m-green/mc-sorso/wiki) for more information.

## How to use:
1. Compress `assets/` and `pack.mcmeta` into `Solresol.zip`.
2. Move `Solresol.zip` into `resourcepacks/`.
3. Enable the Solresol resource pack atop whatever other resource packs are in use (if any).
4. From Title Screen: `Options...` => `Language...` => select Solresol (probably hanging around letter 's' regardless of its current label, probably `Modern Solresol`)
