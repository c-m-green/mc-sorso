A Solresol resource pack for Minecraft, primarily intended to add Modern Solresol as a language choice

## How to use:
1. Compress this project's file into `Solresol.zip`.
2. Move `Solresol.zip` into `resourcepacks/`.
3. Enable the Solresol resource pack atop whatever other resource packs are in use (if any).
4. From Main Menu: `Options...` => `Language...` => select Solresol (probably hanging around letter 's' regardless of its current label, such as `Modern Solresol`)
